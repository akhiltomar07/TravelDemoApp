# TravelDemoApp
# Prerequisites- Java 8, TestNG
# This Travel Demo  project is written in Selenium and will serve an example of implementing a Selenium test project with JAVA. Used TestNG(7.5)
# Implemented browsers-  This project will run on Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Firefox
# The project includes custom annotations to comfortably set some test conditions and/or assumptions like skip/require certain tests on execution with specific
browsers and/or override driver options like browser dimension, private mode, cookies, etc. This will increase the possibility to write easily readable and flexible tests.
# The Page-Object-Pattern can be used straight away to specify elements in different page classes
# On test failures, screenshots will automatically be taken and stored under Reports/Screenshots.
# Extent Test Result Report- Extent Report provides a good representation of test execution output and is designed to create reports that are clear to everyone by creating graphs regarding test execution time, overall test result overviews, test result history, etc.
